## Reverse Image Search Algorithm

This repository contains the code for our team project, where we implemented a reverse image search algorithm on our custom website. The project utilizes web scraping techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to efficiently retrieve images based on user queries.

### Key Features

- **Reverse Image Search:** Users can upload an image to find visually similar images.
- **Web Scraping:** Automated scripts to gather images to build our dataset.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks:** Utilization of CNNs for feature extraction and image similarity calculations.
